            <ul>
                <li>Directed by Christopher Nolan and casting well known stars like Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Caine, <em>Interstellar</em> (2014) first released in theatres on November 7, 2014.</li>
                <li>While it is only Nolan’s 5th best grossing film earning $701 million worldwide, it comes behind huge names like <em>The Dark Knight</em> (2008), <em>Oppenheimer</em> (2023), and <em>Inception</em> (2010), and that shows how great Interstellar is holding up to huge names like these.</li>
                <li><em>Interstellar</em> (2014) is a science fiction film set in a world where the earth is struggling from climate change which is also causing food shortages.

                <h3>Interesting Facts About the Film</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In one scene of the film, the scientists are trying to visit a planet where each hour there would take up 7 years back on earth, and this was actually based on Einstein’s theory of relativity which shows how strong gravity slows down time.</li>
                    <li>For many of the scenes filmed on different planets, Nolan decided to shoot at real locations instead of using CGI, which took the cast and crew to some really breathtaking places like Iceland, which made the film that much more realistic.</li>
                    <li>Nobel Prize winner Kip Thorne was an executive producer of the film, which ensured that the depictions of wormholes, black holes, and relativity were scientifically accurate.</li>
